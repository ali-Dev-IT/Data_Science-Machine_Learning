    "# Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning 🚜\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we're going to go through a machine learning project to use the characteristics of bulldozers and their past sales prices to predict the sale price of future bulldozers based on their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inputs:** Bulldozer characteristics such as make year, base model, model series, state of sale (e.g. which US state was it sold in), drive system and more.\n",
    "* **Outputs:** Bulldozer sale price (in USD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're trying to predict a number, this kind of problem is known as a **regression problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "And since we're going to predicting results with a time component (predicting future sales based on past sales), this is also known as a **time series** or **forecasting** problem."

    "3. **Test.csv** - Historical bulldozer sales examples from May 1 2012 to November 2012 (close to 12,000 examples but missing the `SalePrice` attribute, as this is what we'll be trying to predict)."

    "For this problem, [Kaggle has set the evaluation metric to being root mean squared log error (RMSLE)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation). As with many regression evaluations, the goal will be to get this value as low as possible (a low error value means our model's predictions are close to what the real values are).\n",

    "To see how well our model is doing, we'll calculate the RMSLE and then compare our results to others on the [Kaggle leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/leaderboard)."

    "| **Fill with mode of column** | - Easy to calculate/implement <br> - More useful for categorical-like data | - May not make sense for continuous/numerical data  |\n",
    "| **Fill with 0 (or another constant)** | - Simple to implement <br> - Useful in certain contexts like counts  | - Introduces bias (e.g. if 0 was a value that meant something) <br> - Skews data (e.g. if many missing values, replacing all with 0 makes it look like that's the most common value)  |\n",
    "| **Forward/Backward fill (use previous/future values to fill future/previous values)**  | - Maintains temporal continuity (for time series) | - Assumes data is continuous, which may not be valid |\n",
    "| **Use a calculation from other columns** | - Takes existing information and reinterprets it | - Can result in unlikely outputs if calculations are not continuous |\n",
    "| **Interpolate  (e.g. like dragging a cell in Excel/Google Sheets)** | - Captures trends <br> - Suitable for ordered data | - Can introduce errors <br> - May assume linearity (data continues in a straight line) |\n",
    "| **Drop missing values** | - Ensures complete data (only use samples with all information) <br> - Useful for small datasets | - Can result in data loss (e.g. if many missing values are scattered across columns, data size can be dramatically reduced) <br> - Reduces dataset size  |\n",
